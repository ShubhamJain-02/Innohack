AI based VR fire drill- Traditional fire drills are difficult to conduct, expensive and may have
little effect on the trainees. While fire drills conducted through a virtual reality platform provide a
3D simulation of a real-time scenario, are immersive, and help trainees to interact with the
simulated environment and AI based feedback system.
VIRTUAL REALITY FIRE DRILL - an immersive fire drill
● Training and Testing scenarios present during a fire.
● The reaction time and response will be noted and hence an analysis will be provided at
the end if the child would end up safe or not. Hints will be provided simultaneously once the
option is chosen which would allow the user to know if the response chosen is suitable or
not.
● On a similar background we’re gonna use VR to implement an effective fire safety drill.It will be
an interactive way to indulge the kids into safety training in schools.
